            As mobile devices get more powerful, developers are now able to run more and more complex deep learning models on users devices. 
            An example of this is googles new "DermAssist" which allows users access to a fast and accurate diagnosis of skin conditions.
            The app processes the images without them ever having to leave the users device using TensorFlow.js and draws from a database of conditions to provide helpful advice and information on the severity and symptoms of the condition.
            This is helpful as there may be a large waiting list to see a specialist or some people may not be able to access healthcare at all.
          </p>

          <p>
            The model has been trained and tested with many different skin types to reduce the risk of biases in the predictions.
            It has recently been clinically validated in the EU.

            Google has also been developing many other tools to help in the healthcare industry such as models to help diagnose and treat conditions such as breast cancer, tuberculosis and lung cancer.
