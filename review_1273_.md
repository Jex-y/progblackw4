Firstly some tiny, no where near as bad as mine, HTML errors:
Index line 58-59
bees line 81
healthcare line: 55 and 60
Ive commented them in the respective places, it looks something like <!--Dariusz XYZ--->

1.) Interest of Content
It was an interesting read and a very successful attempt at building an "info website".

   -Excellent

2.) Consistency and quality of visual presentation
The website is consistent everywhere. The colour scheme and layout definitely help to make it feel like a modern website. One thing I will say however is that on smaller screens there is definitely a problem between the overlap of the blue box containing the heading (and the author details) and the main paragraphs of the website.

-Very good

3.) Quality of written presentation
All the content is very well written, a couple of spelling errors but thats not a problem ;). Not that it matters but writing more, maybe a paragraph or two on each page more would definetly add to the overall aesthetic and feel of the website. 

-Very good

4.) Validity of HTML
Not much to say here. Almost no errors

- Outstanding

5.) Evidence of collaboration including

- Exemplary
