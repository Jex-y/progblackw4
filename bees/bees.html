          Tech firms are beginning to implement technolgy into hives which allow beekeepers to monitor the state of their hives, aiming to reduce losses and improve bee health
          One ireland based tech firm <a href = "https://apisprotect.com/technology/">ApisProtect</a> has launched a sensor that alerts beekeepers if there is a problem in their hives. 
            The small sensor is internet connected and placed under the roof of the beehive, it measures a number of metrics including temprature, humidity, sound and movement.
            The data is sent via the cloud to ApisProtect's HQ where the data is proccessed, analyzed and then sent back to the beekeeper.

            Another startup called <a href="https://pollenity.com/about/">Pollenity</a> they have also devolped a sensor which can help to monitor your hives. But they are also aiming to devolp a robot bee which is capable
            of "Dancing" to direct the hive's swarm. This robot bee will tell other bees where to find nectar and pollen and also help them to avoid hazardous areas. They are also aiming
            to be able to detect if a bee has posined by pesticides.
